Looking for a new camera?

Insert your Flickr API key into a file called 'api_key' in this
directory.
You need to have the Python Flickr API installed.

Use the pip tool on Linux to install it:

$ sudo pip install flickrapi


Or download it directly from the Python Package Index:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flickrapi

To see if everything works:

$ python2 -i flickr.py
